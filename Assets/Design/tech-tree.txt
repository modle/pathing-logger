Side effects of Manuf/Mass Production
- Possible penalties for deciding certain tech paths in game, perks for others
- ultimate penalty is that resource becomes too scarce or edible plants become exponentially more expensive to cultivate
- MegaFauna extinction
- The rhino horn thing? Engineer fake horns to flood the market
- Divided habitats -> less diverse gene pools -> extinction -> or evolution into aggressive competitor species
